        <h1>Musab Al-Adani</h1>
        <p>Musab Al-Adani (Arabic: مصعب العدني) otherwise known as Abu Musab Al-Adani is an Yemeni-Arabic speaking Anasheed artist popular in the Middle East. Although not much information is known about him, nor do any reliable sources cover about him, rumours in TikTok say that he is currently in an Houthi prison in Abyan because of an nasheed made by him called "Prisoner Of Thoughts". Another rumour states that Musab Al-Adani is with Al-Qaeda because of the violence he uses in his nasheeds. Musab Al-Adani has nasheeds on various music platforms, edited by professionals.</p>
